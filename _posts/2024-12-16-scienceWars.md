### What is Science and Its Role in Society?  

What is science? What is its place in society? Does it deserve the privilege it holds in Western culture?  

**Spoiler**: Yes, it absolutely does.  

This category is dedicated to the science wars and why scientific realism is the only viable position and any other position is not only wrong but are an active threat to society. This is not a [hyperbole](https://scholar.harvard.edu/kleelerner/publications/lysenkoism-deadly-mix-pseudoscience-and-political-ideology).

### The Case for Scientific Realism  

**Scientific realism** is the philosophical stance that well-confirmed scientific theories are approximately true and that the entities they describe—both observable and unobservable—exist. This means that science provides us with a reliable and progressively accurate picture of the world.

In contrast, **scientific anti-realism** claims that we cannot determine whether scientific theories are true or false. Instead, it focuses solely on their utility for predicting and explaining observable phenomena, disregarding their truth value. 

But scientific anti-realism is not the main impediment to progress. It is the **political ideologies** that have hijacked science and used it as a tool to advance their own perverted agendas. Particularly, social constructivism and postmodernism. The appeal to emotion and the rejection of objective truth are the hallmarks of these ideologies. Calling science "white supremacy" or "sexist" of them trying to dupe the public by appealing to their emotions to advance their own agenda. A prime example of this is Sandra Harding referring Newton's theory as his "rape theory".


> Fire burns equally well whether it is worshipped or not.

I am vehemently a **scientific realist**. Any so-called "alternative perspectives" such as **postmodernism**, **social constructivism**, and **scientific anti-realism**—are not only flawed but actively dangerous to society.

Science is not merely a social construct or a tool for prediction; it is humanity’s best method for understanding the world as it truly is. The undermining of science through politically charged ideologies threatens its role as a foundation for progress and truth. This is not a hypothetical concern, [it happened in the past](https://scholar.harvard.edu/kleelerner/publications/lysenkoism-deadly-mix-pseudoscience-and-political-ideology) and it can happen again.

Science wars, in its modern form, is not a fight against opposing views; its a fight against modern Lysenkoism which can and will destroy our society just like it did in the USSR when Lysenko tried to put his political agenda over science.

To learn more about the science wars and how to fight it, please watch the following video by a physicist whose views I fully reciprocate:
