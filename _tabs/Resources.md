This is a non-exhaustive list of resources that I have found useful. I will update this list as I find more resources. **Note:** most books can be found on web if you know how to look ;)

# Physics

Before I make my list I would like to mention other popular recommendations that may be useful.
- [John Baez's list for learning physics and math](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/books.html)
- [Teach Yourself Physics: a travel companion by Jakob Schwichtenberg](https://www.amazon.com/Teach-Yourself-Physics-travel-companion/dp/3948763003/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1)
    This is a new book on the subject of self-teaching physics. It is a great resource for those who want to learn physics on their own. Schwichtenberg has written other beginner friendly books such as No-Nonsense Classical Mechanics and No-Nonsense Quantum Mechanics.
- [Susan Flowers blog on learning physics](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics)
-  [King Crokoduck's video on becoming a physicist](https://youtu.be/Kk8q500rYo4?si=GU3bGtLwWvbOlbgD)
  This was a very inspirational video for me when I was in High School. I recommend every aspiring physicist watching this video.

## Books
These are mainly textbooks or books that require a bit more work to read.

## Conceptual  Physics
These are books that are more conceptual and less mathematical. If you are an absolute beginner, I would recommend starting with these books. They require very little math and are very easy to read.
- [Inquiry into Physics by Vern J. Ostdiek](https://www.google.com/books/edition/PHYSICS/VqGzQAAACAAJ?hl=en)
    I used this one in High School when I was struggling with thermodynamics. The explanations are clear and lucid. I highly recommend beginners to read this book.
- [Conceptual Physics by Paul G. Hewitt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1748875.Conceptual_Physics)
  Popular conceptual physics book. I have not read this book but it is highly recommended by many people. Its similar to the book above. Hewitt also has video lectures on YouTube on this book [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiTn8fjRICQ&list=PL8I5RNSPIfaZF4Qqsh-m_BUSHww59cnZI).
- [Feynman Lectures on Physics by Richard Feynman](https://www.amazon.com/Feynman-Lectures-Physics-Vol-1/dp/0201021161) 
 No book recommendation list would be complete without Feynman's lectures. These lectures are a must read for anyone who wants to learn physics. Feynman's lectures are a great resource for anyone who wants to learn physics. Volume one is more conceptual and is freely available online.

Some books that are widely slept on in the west is those of the Soviet era which are very well written and are very accessible, and of course translated into English. These freely available books are a trasure trove as basic physics has not changed in the last 100 years.They are still used in other countries like Brazil and India, and are highly reguarded. Here are some of them for getting the basics:

- [Elementary Textbook On Physics by G. S. Landsberg](https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22G.+S.+Landsberg+%28Ed.%29%22)
 This is very popular and is a 3 volume series teaching basic physics in the most accessible way imaginable. Give it a try, its free!

- [Physics for everyone by Landau and Kitaigorodsky](https://mirtitles.org/2011/06/03/physics-for-everyone/)
  Lev Landau is one of the giants of 20th century physics. You will learn more about him as you advance in theoretical physics. He is an interesting character to say the least. If you want to know who Landau is check his wikipedia page as listing all his accomplishments would take a while.

These are all the books I have read and/or heard good things about. If you like these Soviet era books then mirtitles.org is a great resource for finding more.

## Classical Mechanics

Now we get to some of the meatier books. If you worked through some of the books above, you may be able to skip some of these. I will break this list into three parts: Introductory, Intermediate, and Advanced. If you worked through books above you may skip the introductory books but make sure to do the problems from at least one of the books or you can also use the [Schaum's outline 3000 solved problems in physics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/308173.3_000_Solved_Problems_in_Physics_Schaum_s_Solved_Problems_). Rememmber learing physics is about *problem-solving*, you are fooling yourself if you think you can learn physics by reading books which I think is the problem with most people who simply read pop-sci books and think they know physics.


## Introductory

The following books require calculus as a prerequisite. I will put resources for learning calculus in math section.

- [Newtonian Mechanics by A.P. French](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/431054.Newtonian_Mechanics)
 This is a introduction to Newtonian mechanics used by undergraduates in physics. Unlike other books it has answers to all the problems.

- [Electricity and Magnetism by Purcell and Morin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144336665-electricity-and-magnetism)
 This is the standard textbook for electricity and magnetism. It is also great way to learn vectorr calculus intuitively.

- [Viberations and Waves by A.P. French](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10915367-vibrations-and-waves)
  This is a sequel to the Newtonian Mechanics book.
